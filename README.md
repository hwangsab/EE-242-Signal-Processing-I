## Introduction:
Signal Processing is a fundamental field in electrical engineering that deals with the analysis, manipulation, and interpretation of signals. This repository aims to provide hands-on experience with various signal processing techniques through interactive Jupyter Notebook exercises.

## Installation:
To use the notebooks in this repository, follow the steps below:

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/EE-242-Signal-Processing-I.git`
   
  3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the Python website.
   
  4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
  5. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to start working with the notebooks

## Usage:
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the desired Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Each notebook contains a set of exercises with instructions and code cells. Execute the cells to see the results and interact with the signal processing techniques.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and explore further signal processing concepts on your own.
